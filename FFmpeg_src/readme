Android NDK Version r5c
FFmpeg version 1.1

ffmpeg raw video buffer size should be updated according to size of raw data. This is the difference between original
ffmpeg and the ffmpeg we used. This update frees us to not convert raw video to jpeg and jpeg to encoded video. 
We can directly convert raw data to encoded video with this buffer size update.
