Privacy\n
There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a butterfly account, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.\n

Our Privacy Policy explains:\n

What information we collect and why we collect it.\n
How we use that information.\n
The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.\n

\n
Information we collect\n
We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online.\n

We collect information in two ways:\n

Information you give us.\n
We record your e-mail address when you use the Butterfly app.\n
Information we get from your use of our services.\n

\n
Log information\n
When you use our services or view content provided by butterfly, we may automatically collect and store certain information inserver logs. This may include:\n
details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.\n

Internet protocol address. (IP adress)\n
device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.\n
\n
Location information\n
When you use a location-enabled butterfly service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.\n
\n
Unique application numbers\n
Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to butterfly when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.\n
\n
How we use information we collect\n
We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect butterfly and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.\n
When you contact butterfly, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.\n
We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.\n
Butterfly processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.\n

\n
Transparency and choice\n
People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:\n

From butterfly sharing broadcast section you can edit who you can share your broadcast with\n

We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).\n

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.\n

Information we share\n
We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of butterfly unless one of the following circumstances apply:\n

With your consent\n
We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of butterfly when we have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.\n
\n

For external processing\n
We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.\n
For legal reasons\n
We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of butterfly if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\n
meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.\n
enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.\n
detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.\n
protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of butterfly, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.\n
We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.\n

If butterfly is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n
\n
Information security\n
We work hard to protect butterfly and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:\n

We restrict access to personal information to butterfly employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\n
Application\n
Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by butterfly and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.\n



Enforcement\n
We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.\n

Changes\n
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. Updated privacy policy is published here.\n
